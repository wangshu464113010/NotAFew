We won't have a Christmas this year,you say
For now the children have all gone away;
And the house is so lonely, so quiet and so bare
We couldn't have a Christmas that they didn't share
We won't have a Christmas this year,you sigh,
For Christmas means things that money must buy.
Misfortunes and illness have robbed us we fear
Of the things that we'd need to make Christmas this year.
We won't have a Christmas this year you weep,
For a loved one is gone,and our grief is too deep;
It will be a long time bfore our hearts heal,
And the spirit of Christmas again we can feel.
But if you lose Christmas when troubles befall,
You never have really had Christmas at all.
For once you have had it,it cannont depart
When you learn that true Christmas is Christ in your heart.

Security is mostly a superstition.
It does not exist in nature,
nor do the children of men
as a whole experience it.
Avoiding danger is no safer
in the long run than outright exposure.
Life is either a daring adventure,or nothing.
To keep our faces toward change and
behave like free spirits
in the presence of fate is strength undefeatble.

Gather ye rosebuds while you may,
快采下玫瑰花蕾，
Old times still a-filying;
And this same flower that smiles today,
To-morrow will be dying.
The glorious lamp of heaven,the sun,
The higher he's a-getting;
The sooner will his race be run,
And nearer he's to setting.
That age is best which is the first,
When youth and blood are warmer;
But being spent,the worse,and worst,
Times still succeed the former.
Then be not coy,but use your time,
And while ye may,go marry;
For having lost but once your prime,
You may for ever tarry.
