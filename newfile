We won't have a Christmas this year,you say
For now the children have all gone away;
And the house is so lonely, so quiet and so bare
We couldn't have a Christmas that they didn't share
We won't have a Christmas this year,you sigh,
For Christmas means things that money must buy.
Misfortunes and illness have robbed us we fear
Of the things that we'd need to make Christmas this year.
We won't have a Christmas this year you weep,
For a loved one is gone,and our grief is too deep;
It will be a long time bfore our hearts heal,
And the spirit of Christmas again we can feel.
But if you lose Christmas when troubles befall,
You never have really had Christmas at all.
For once you have had it,it cannont depart
When you learn that true Christmas is Christ in your heart.

Security is mostly a superstition.
It does not exist in nature,
nor do the children of men
as a whole experience it.
Avoiding danger is no safer
in the long run than outright exposure.
Life is either a daring adventure,or nothing.
To keep our faces toward change and
behave like free spirits
in the presence of fate is strength undefeatble.

Gather ye rosebuds while you may,
快采下玫瑰花蕾，
Old times still a-filying;
往昔如风恐难追；
And this same flower that smiles today,
近日融融话语笑，
To-morrow will be dying.
明日寂寂残红坠。
The glorious lamp of heaven,the sun,
灿灿朝霞比天灯，
The higher he's a-getting;
载光载热朝天腾；
The sooner will his race be run,
疾疾而行途乃近，
And nearer he's to setting.
昏昏暮霭落九层。
That age is best which is the first,
年当豆蔻风华优，
When youth and blood are warmer;
精力充沛血仍稠；
But being spent,the worse,and worst,
韵华虚度朱颜改，
Times still succeed the former.
春复秋来月悠悠。
Then be not coy,but use your time,
莫因娇羞惜爱玲，
And while ye may,go marry;
趁此春光嫁少年。
For having lost but once your prime,
等闲负了青春约，
You may for ever tarry.
此生难再觅良缘。
